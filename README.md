# Tutedudeassignment2 learnings
#Task1 tells about to check whether the number is even or odd using if-else statement. so the programme takes an input in number from user and tells them its a even or odd number

#Task2 tells to show sum of first 50 numbers using for loop. so i have created a for loop that adds each number to the sum of previous numbers and atlast total sum of 50 numbers is printed on the screen.
